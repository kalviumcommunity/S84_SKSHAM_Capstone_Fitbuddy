FitBuddy: Gym Exercise & Calorie Tracker

🧠 Project Idea & Description

FitBuddy is a fitness tracking web application designed for both desktop and mobile users. It helps people stay consistent with their health goals by tracking their daily workouts and calories burned.

Users can log different types of exercises — like cardio, strength training, yoga, and more — and input details such as duration, intensity, and workout type. Based on this, the app automatically calculates the calories burned.

The platform also features visual charts and simple stats so users can easily monitor their progress over time. It works like a personal digital fitness log, making it easier to stay motivated.

FitBuddy is perfect for gym-lover and fitness lovers who want a clean, easy way to manage their fitness routines — anytime, anywhere.





The project includes:

📊 A responsive React.js frontend with a clean dark mode UI

🛠️ A secure backend using Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB

🔐 User authentication with JWT & Google OAuth

📋 A calorie counter and exercise tracker

🧑‍💼 Admin dashboard to manage users & exercise data

📈 Interactive charts and progress summaries





The goal is to empower users to better manage their fitness journey with personalized tracking and data insights.

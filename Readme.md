FitBuddy: Gym Exercise & Calorie Tracker



🧠 Project Idea & Description
FitBuddy is a fitness web application made mainly for desktop users. It helps people track their daily workouts, exercises, and calories burned. The goal is to help users stay consistent with their fitness journey.

Users can log each exercise they do — like running, weightlifting, or yoga — and enter details such as time spent, type of workout, and how intense it was. Based on this, the app will calculate how many calories were burned.

FitBuddy will also show simple and easy-to-understand charts or stats, so users can see their progress over time. It’s like having your own digital workout tracker and calorie calculator, all in one place.

This app is perfect for gym-goers and fitness lovers who want to keep a record of their workouts and stay motivated by seeing how far they’ve come.



The project includes:

📊 A responsive React.js frontend with a clean dark mode UI

🛠️ A secure backend using Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB

🔐 User authentication with JWT & Google OAuth

📋 A calorie counter and exercise tracker

🧑‍💼 Admin dashboard to manage users & exercise data

📈 Interactive charts and progress summaries





The goal is to empower users to better manage their fitness journey with personalized tracking and data insights.
